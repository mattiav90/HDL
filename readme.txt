implementation of a Finite State Machine (FSM).
We'll implement a 4-state FSM that recognizes a specific input 
pattern: "101" pattern detector â€” the FSM outputs 1 when it 
detects the sequence:

1 -> 0 -> 1 on a serial input stream.


it will be imoplemented starting from a simple one and then
make it more efficient.
