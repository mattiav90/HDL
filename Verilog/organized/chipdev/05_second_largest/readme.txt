Prompt
Given a clocked sequence of unsigned values, output the 
second-largest value seen so far in the sequence. If only one
 value is seen, then the output (dout) should equal 0. Note that 
 repeated values are treated as separate candidates for being the 
 second largest value.

When the reset-low signal (resetn) goes low, all previous
 values seen in the input sequence should no longer be considered
  for the calculation of the second largest value, and the output 
  dout should restart from 0 on the next cycle.

Input and Output Signals
clk - Clock signal
resetn - Synchronous reset-low signal
din - Input data sequence
dout - Second-largest value seen so far
Output signals during reset
dout - 0 when resetn is active
