Build a circuit that generates a Gray code sequence starting from 0 on the output (dout).

Gray code is an ordering of binary numbers such that two successive values only have one bit difference between them. For example, a Gray code sequence for a two bit value could be:

b00
b01
b11
b10

The Gray code sequence should use the standard encoding. In the standard encoding the least significant bit follows a repetitive pattern of 2 on, 2 off ( ... 11001100 ... ); the next digit a pattern of 4 on, 4 off ( ... 1111000011110000 ... ); the nth least significant bit a pattern of 2n on 2n off.

When the reset-low signal (resetn) goes to 0, the Gray code sequence should restart from 0.

Input and Output Signals
clk - Clock signal
resetn - Synchronous reset-low signal
out - Gray code counter value
Output signals during reset
out - 0 when resetn is active
